scena1-text = Help me define which metals compose my hatchet, using the XRF method!
scena1-zacni = Start >

scena2-text = Because the object is composed of different metals, two separate measuring points were chosen. Both measurements were performed with x-rays.

scena3-text0 = Atomic structure of iron.
scena3-text1 = A proton dislodges the electron.
scena3-text2 = An outer shell electron replaces inner shell vacancy.
scena3-text3 = One of possible results is emitting of photon with characteristic energy.
scena3-text4 = A proton dislodges the electron.
scena3-text5 = An higher outer shell electron replaces inner shell vacancy.
scena3-text6 = A photon emits with characteristic energy.

scene3-graph-title = Sensor graph:
scene3-graph-y  = Counts / s
scene3-graph-x  = Characteristic Energy (keV)


scene4-image-title = Search for peak values of each element.
scene4-text1 = Each chemical element has a characteristic energy.
scene4-text2 = To determine an element you need to search for Kα and Kβ peak values and find them in the table.

scene5-help-ziva = Help Živa define which metals compose her hatchet by comparing peaks on graph and values in table.

scene6-graph-title = 1. Search for peak values of each element.
scene6-table-title = 2. Find the elements with the corresponding characteristic energies.
scene6-check-btn = Check your answers

scene7-ok-ans = Congratulations! You've made it!
scene7-nok-ans = Oops! Let's try again.
scene7-to-start = To beginning
scene7-retry = Try again
